# Oil Field Purchase Problem

## Description
This problem explores the decision-making process of an oil company considering the purchase of an oil field under uncertainty. The company can conduct a geological test before making a purchase decision, balancing the cost of the test with the potential insights it provides. 

The problem is modeled using an influence diagram implemented in [PyAgrum](https://pyagrum.readthedocs.io/).
