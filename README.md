# Decision Theory Problems

This repository contains a collection of decision theory problems, each located within the `problems` directory. Every problem is structured within its own folder, containing a `README.md` file with a brief explanation and a Jupyter notebook with a detailed problem description and implementation. The implementations use influence diagrams, also known as decision networks ([Howard and Matheson, 1984](https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/decision/1983-howard-readingsondecisionanalysis-v1.pdf)), with the Python library [PyAgrum](https://pyagrum.readthedocs.io/).

## Problems
