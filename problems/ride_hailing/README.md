# Ride-Hailing Subscription Service

## Description
This problem explores the decision-making process of a ride-hailing company considering whether to offer a special retention offer to its existing customers in order to prevent churn. The company has collected data through a market study indicating that a significant portion of its current customer base may switch to competitors unless service quality or pricing is improved. In response, the company prepares an exclusive offer, but must decide whether to implement it and how to structure it. 

The problem is modeled using an influence diagram implemented in [PyAgrum](https://pyagrum.readthedocs.io/).
